## How Design System Generation Works

1.  **USER REQUEST**: "Build a landing page for my beauty spa"
2.  **MULTI-DOMAIN SEARCH**: It searches product type, style, color palette, patterns, and typography.
3.  **REASONING ENGINE**: Match product to UI category rules, apply style priorities, filter anti-patterns.
4.  **COMPLETE DESIGN SYSTEM OUTPUT**: Generate the full system.
