================================================

CLIENT OVERVIEW
---------------
Clients: Jeremy & Bobby
Business: Squirrel Made Products
Location: Home-based, production in a shared kitchen in Marietta, GA
Industry: Artisanal food products (olive oils and similar items)

Squirrel Made is a small, home-based artisanal food business that has relied primarily
on in-person sales at farmers' markets and festivals for the past three years. The
owners are looking to transition to an online-focused sales model as in-person events
are becoming physically unsustainable. They have an existing customer base of repeat
buyers but struggle with new customer acquisition online. Their current website is
underperforming and they have limited social media presence (Instagram only) with no
experience running digital ads.
