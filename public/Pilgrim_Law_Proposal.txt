CREATIVE COWBOYS
Digital Marketing & Web Strategy

MARKETING PROPOSAL
Prepared for: Pilgrim Law Group
Date: February 25, 2026

================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Thank you for the opportunity to meet with Pilgrim Law Group today. After nearly
twenty years of practice and over $150 million in settlements secured for clients
across West Georgia, your firm has built an exceptional reputation — and we believe
your digital presence should reflect that strength.

This proposal outlines a comprehensive digital strategy to address the challenges
we discussed: low-quality online leads, an outdated website, limited visibility
against large Atlanta-based competitors, and an underdeveloped social media
presence. Creative Cowboys will work alongside your team to build a dominant local
brand that attracts the serious clients your firm deserves.

Our approach is straightforward: no fluff, no vanity metrics — only strategies
that put qualified clients in front of your attorneys.

================================================================================

UNDERSTANDING YOUR NEEDS

Based on our conversation today, we've identified the following key priorities
for Pilgrim Law Group:

LEAD QUALITY & MANAGEMENT
- Current website leads are unqualified — prospects who have contacted multiple
  firms and are price shopping.
- No formal CRM in place; leads tracked ad-hoc via email, creating gaps in
  follow-up.
- Need for an intelligent intake system that pre-qualifies clients before they
  reach your staff.

WEBSITE & TECHNOLOGY
- WordPress site on GoDaddy is slow, outdated, and hurting search rankings.
- Site fails to project the image of a large, formidable legal team.
- No modern scheduling or intake flow aligned to your dynamic attorney schedules.

SEARCH VISIBILITY & COMPETITION
- Difficult to compete with large Atlanta firms on Google Ads due to budget
  disparity.
- Opportunity to dominate the Google "map pack" for local West Georgia searches.
- Niche specialization in digital crimes represents an under-served keyword
  opportunity.

BRAND IMAGE & CONTENT
- Firm needs to project strength and resources — especially for clients evaluating
  multiple attorneys.
- Trial wins and major settlements are not being publicized, ceding the narrative
  to the DA's office.
- Social media presence is underdeveloped for the 17-35 target demographic.
- Your team's film and video background is a significant, untapped content asset.

================================================================================

PROPOSED SERVICES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. NEW WEBSITE DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will design and build a modern, fast website that positions Pilgrim Law Group
as the dominant legal force in West Georgia. Your new site will be built on a
high-performance platform (away from WordPress) to maximize load speed and Google
ranking potential.

Key deliverables include:
- Custom design conveying strength, credibility, and professional scale
- Individual attorney profiles (photo, bio, accolades) for willing team members
  — with professional text-based profiles for those who prefer not to be
  photographed
- "Real Results" section showcasing major settlements and trial victories
- AI-powered lead intake chatbot to screen prospects, ask qualifying questions,
  and collect callback preferences — giving your staff a full summary before they
  pick up the phone
- "Request a Call" smart form replacing traditional scheduling — clients choose
  preferred time windows, staff confirm based on real-time availability
- Mobile-first, SEO-optimized build with fast load times
- Integration with a recommended CRM for structured lead tracking

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. LOCAL SEO & GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE OPTIMIZATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will implement a hyper-local SEO strategy to dominate the Google map pack for
high-value searches in Haralson, Polk, Paulding, Carroll, Douglas, Coweta, and
surrounding counties — searches your target clients are making right now.

- Full Google Business Profile audit and optimization
- Location-specific keyword targeting (e.g., "Carrollton personal injury
  attorney," "Haralson criminal defense lawyer")
- Monthly review generation strategy to build social proof and ranking signals
- On-page SEO across all practice areas: personal injury, criminal law, domestic
  law, and digital crimes
- Content marketing targeting your niche expertise in internet-based crimes —
  a growing and under-served keyword category
- Ongoing rank tracking and transparent monthly reporting

Typical timeline: early ranking improvements within 3-4 months; significant map
pack results in months 4-6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY & CONTENT DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will develop a strategic social media presence targeting your 17-35 demographic
on the platforms where they spend their time: Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.
Your team's background in film and video makes this a genuine competitive
advantage.

- Full social media audit and platform setup/optimization
- Content calendar with consistent posting schedule
- "Legal Explained" short-form video series — bite-sized videos breaking down
  legal concepts relevant to your practice areas, inspired by the low-production,
  high-authenticity approach your team admires
- "Real Results" content series: written and video posts publicizing trial wins,
  significant settlements, and major case outcomes — countering the DA's
  narrative with your own story
- Targeted paid social campaigns on Facebook and Instagram, geo-targeted to
  West Georgia zip codes
- Strategy and guidance for in-house content creation, leveraging your team's
  video skills
- Strict editorial review process — no content published without attorney
  approval, addressing your concerns from past vendor experiences

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. CRM & LEAD MANAGEMENT SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will research and recommend a CRM solution suited to a law firm of your size
and complexity — one that integrates with your new website intake system and
allows your team to move beyond ad-hoc email tracking.

- CRM platform evaluation and recommendation
- Setup, configuration, and basic workflow automation
- Lead source tracking to identify which channels are driving your best cases
- Staff training and onboarding support
